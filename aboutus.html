            <hr>
            <p>Legal Aid Society is a private, non-profit organization that provides free legal services to people with low income.
                We do not take criminal cases. We only do civil cases--cases where you yourself will not be sent to jail. We have 8
                offices that serve 48 Tennessee counties. Our offices are in Clarksville, Columbia, Cookeville, Gallatin, Murfeesboro,
                Nashville, Oak Ridge and Tullahoma. More info about Legal Aid Society can be found at our website, www.las.org</p>
            <h3>Mission and Priorities Statement</h3>
            <p>Legal Aid Society's mission is to advance, defend, and enforce the legal rights of low-income and vulnerable people
                in order to secure for them the basic necessities of life. We will give priority to cases and matters in which we
                can assist in preserving the home, obtaining housing, maintaining economic stability, preventing domestic violence,
                obtaining health care, and/or encouraging family stability.</p>
            <h3>Impact Statement</h3>
            <p>America was founded on the concept of equal justice for everyone.... it is confirmed in our pledge of allegiance and
                it is written above the doors of many courthouses, including the Supreme Court. However, there is a gap in our
                system. In civil cases, people who cannot afford legal representation usually must struggle alone against
                complicated government programs, individuals and entities in a position of power who are taking advantage of them,
                and violent family members. Legal Aid Society strives to fill that gap, helping to preserve that precious,
                cornerstone American value of justice for all.</p>
            <h3>Background Statement</h3>
            <p>The Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands was founded in 1968 as Legal Services of Nashville by
                eight members of the Nashville Bar Association. It has since expanded and consolidated with other organizations to
                help low-income people in 48 counties through eight offices.</p>
            <p>Legal Aid Society has earned a national reputation for the excellence of its work. It has prompted reform of public
                excellence of its work. It has prompted reform of public institutions and has exerted a major influence on the
                development of Tennessee law. It is a national leader in community education, producing creative self-help legal
                advice products that have been used throughout the country.</p>
            <p>In 1996, changes in federal policy created new restrictions on the work that we could do while receiving Legal
                Services Corporation funds. We have since focused solely on individual cases and community education, and are no
                longer involved in class action lawsuits.</p>
            <p>Individual representation is provided free of charge to over 7,000 people each year. The cases address civil legal
                problems that are critical to low-income people. The needs are prioritized and met through the following
                initiatives: protecting the elderly; protecting victims of domestic violence; representing children from violend
                homes; representing tramatic brain injury victims; access to healthcare; access to appropriate education for
                disabled children; medical-legal collaborative; preventing homelessness and financial crisis; Tennessee Taxpayers
                Project; Pro Bono Program; and community education.</p>
